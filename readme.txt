Couldnt upload my pycache,instance with the db in it, or the venv. google said you dont normally have to upload those files so i think i should be good? if i do need those i can screenshot them over if needed
I dont think not having htem will cause any harm. 
I can never remember if I do need to upload them or to ignore them. 
I just couldnt figure out how to get an error message for when posting the info in postman, for when i was missing a field.
like it would just show one error message at a time, not the you are missing, title,ratings and year at the same time.
